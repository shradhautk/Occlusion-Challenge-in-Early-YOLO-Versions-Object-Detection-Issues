# Occlusion-Challenge-in-Early-YOLO-Versions-Object-Detection-Issues
Dive into the occlusion challenges encountered by early YOLO (You Only Look Once) versions V1, V2, and V3, with a specific focus on issues related to object detection. Enclosed within is a codebase primed for elevating the precision and resilience of object detection models, especially when faced with scenarios involving partially hidden objects. This resource caters to researchers and developers eager to enhance YOLO-based object detection algorithms. It offers a suite of functions, meticulously crafted for tasks related to bounding boxes and object detection evaluation. These encompass functions for computing the intersection over union (IoU) between bounding boxes, discerning occlusion between boxes, and assessing the average precision of object detection outcomes.
